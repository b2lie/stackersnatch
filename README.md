## 🤷🏻‍♀️ What's this about even?

Theory of Automata (CS3005) was a course offered to us as part of our Comp. Sci. Bachelor's degree during our 4th semester @ FAST NUCES. My friends, Muntaha Adnan and Anumta Nadeem, and I were tasked with creating both a hardware and a software project to highlight how well we'd retained the topics we'd covered in class. 

Among the many options offered for the software task, this one stood out to me the most - it challenged us to take our understanding of Pushdown Automata (PDA) and turn it into something genuinely useful (and fun!) for other students who might be struggling with the topic.

This was also my *first-ever react project*, so I dove headfirst into learning it while building this simulation from scratch. Heh.

**Our goal?**
Help players see how a PDA works, using a game-like interface to make the concept easier to understand and way more engaging.

## 👾 Features:

- [ ] Interactive Stack Visualization
- [ ] Puzzle Levels Increasing in Difficulty [_in progress_]
- [ ] Leaderboard & Scoring System

<br/>

## 😿 Note to self (and anyone reading):

**This is a project that was definitely rushed** and could use a bit of repolishing - juggling other assignments and deadlines made it harder to finish everything we'd envisioned, I'll admit :c <br/>

So yes, **it is incomplete**, for now! It's missing an ε-transition level that we were meaning to add but were unable to do so due to the strict time constraint.

## For anyone wanting to recreate something similar:

These repos really proved to be helpful for me during the learning/research process. Hope they help you out, too!

- [PDA Visual Sandbox](https://github.com/cheezypotatoes/Deterministic-PushDown-Automata-Project)

Happy PDA-simulating :D and best of luck, I know I needed it 😿.<br/>
Also would love to see how you modify this! 😸🧡
