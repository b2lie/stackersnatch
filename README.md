## 🕹 Gamified Stack Battle Simulator

---

## 🤷🏻‍♀️ What's this about even?

Theory of Automata (CS3005) was a course offered to me as part of my Comp. Sci. Bachelor's degree during my 4th semester. We were tasked with creating both a hardware and a software project to highlight how well we'd retained the topics we'd covered in class. Among the many options offered for the software task, this one stood out to me the most - it challenged me to take my understanding of Pushdown Automata (PDA) and turn it into something genuinely useful (and fun!) for other students who might be struggling with the topic.

This was also my *first-ever react project*, so I dove headfirst into learning it while building this simulation from scratch. Heh.

## The goal?

Help players see how a PDA works, using a game-like interface to make the concept easier to understand and way more engaging.

## 👾 features:

- [ ] Interactive Stack Visualization
- [ ] Puzzle Levels Increasing in Difficulty (_in progress_)
- [ ] Leaderboard & Scoring System

## 😿 Note to self (and anyone reading):

**This is a project that was definitely rushed** and could use a bit of repolishing - juggling other assignments and deadlines made it harder to finish everything I had envisioned, I'll admit :c
So yes, **it is incomplete**, for now! It's missing an ε-transition level that I was meaning to add but was unable to do so due to the strict time constraint.

## For anyone wanting to recreate something similar:

These repos really proved to be helpful for me during the learning/research process. Hope they help you out, too!

- [ ] [PDA Visual Sandbox](https://github.com/cheezypotatoes/Deterministic-PushDown-Automata-Project)

Happy PDA-simulating :D and best of luck, I know I needed it 😿.
Also would love to see how you modify this! 😸🧡
